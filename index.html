                <h4>Raya and the last dragon</h4>
                <p>
                    Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. However, when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, those same monsters have returned, and it's up to a lone warrior to track down the last dragon and stop the Druun for good.

                    When I first watched this movie, I felt fantastic because it's interesting. Their animals in this movie are kind of weird, like they're mixing together, for example, butterflies and birds mixing together. In the middle part of the movie, I feel sadness because her father is gone because of druun, but the sadness is gone when she sees the dragon and helps each other to stop them from taking people's souls. I don't want to spoil you in the ending part, but this movie is good. She will do everything to fix the damage to their people and bring back the souls that have gotten and build a new Kumandra.

                    At first, I didn't like this movie because it was kind of boring, but if you watch it and understand it, you will know how important its family is, how to forgive, and how to love them in any ways.

                <h4>The book of life</h4>
                <p>
                    In the Mexican town of San Angel, Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoë Saldana) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have been friends ever since childhood. Although their lives have taken different paths -- Maria was sent to Europe, Joaquin joined the military, and Manolo studied to become a bullfighter -- one thing remains the same: Manolo and Joaquin both want to marry Maria. Little does the trio know that battling husband-and-wife deities have made a high-stakes wager on the love triangle's outcome.

                    I love everything in this movie: the character, the song, everything; it makes me feel a butterfly in my stomach. The character was so lovable he didn't hesitate to exchange his life with his loved one.

                <p>
                    In this movie, I realised that all children don't feel what we feel. In terms of family, we're lucky because we have parents unlike them; they don't have a family to bond in Christmas. They feel unhope because no one adopted them in an orphanage, but everything changes when Santa's dog comes.
